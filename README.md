# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-IRIS-Data-Set
Using EDA I have tried to explore IRIS Data Set, one of the oldest data sets created in 1936.
For information on IRIS Data Set, read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) ?
- It is a task of analyzing the given data using tools from Statistics, Linear Algebra, Plotting tools, etc.
- It is the very first thing to do before providing a model using machine learning.
- Here, we explore the given data as much as wee can, hence the name Exploratory.

## Balanced Data Set
- The data set, viz. IRIS Data Set, used for this problem is balanced data set.
- Each species of the flowers in the data set consists of equal number of data points as given below:
1.Iris Virginica  :  50
2.Iris Versicolor :  50
3.Iris Setosa     :  50

## Features Used
The following features of the flowers are used for the analysis:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
